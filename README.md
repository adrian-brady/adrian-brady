Hi, I'm Adrian Brady. 

As of Fall 2024, I am a Junior at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and pursuing a degree in Computer Sciences.

I’m interested in Programming Languages and Compilers, tech news, politics, city planning and urban development, and computer architecture.

I’m currently learning how to implement a simple single pass compiler from the book Crafting Interpreters. I am also learning simple graphics programming using SDL.
